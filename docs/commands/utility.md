The base class that all cogs must inherit from.

A cog is a collection of commands, listeners, and optional state to
help group commands together. More information on them can be found on
the :ref:`ext_commands_cogs` page.

When inheriting from this class, the options shown in :class:`CogMeta`
are equally valid here.
