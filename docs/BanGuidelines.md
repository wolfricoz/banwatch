# Ban Guidelines

Banwatch is a tool to help you make informed decisions, not a tool to force others to ban users. To ensure a fair and safe environment, we have established the following guidelines and code of conduct.

## Code of Conduct

All users must adhere to the following rules:

-   Do not use the bot to harass or bully other users by spreading false information.
-   Do not use the bot to spam or flood servers.
-   Do not use the bot to spread hate speech or any other form of discrimination.
-   Do not use the bot to spread any form of illegal content.
-   Do not use hate speech or discriminatory language in your ban reasons.
-   Do not pressure other server owners to ban a user. This includes threatening them if they do not comply.

We reserve the right to request proof for a ban if we suspect the reason is false or has a serious impact on a user's reputation.

## Ban Submission Rules

1.  **Bans must be factual.**
    The ban reason should clearly outline the infraction and the rules that were broken (server rules or Discord's ToS). This provides others with enough information to make their own informed decision.

2.  **Claims must be supported by evidence.**
    All bans should be supported with evidence (screenshots, links, etc.). The only exception is for age-related bans to protect privacy.

3.  **Language must be professional.**
    Ban reasons should be clear, concise, and unbiased. Profanity, insults, and slurs are not permitted and will be removed.

The Banwatch team reserves the right to revoke a server's broadcasting ability if these guidelines are repeatedly disregarded after a warning.
