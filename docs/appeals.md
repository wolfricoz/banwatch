## How do appeals work?
Users get one appeal to a server by doing the command `/appeal create`, after they have filled out the modal which pops up, the server will receive a message with two buttons where they can decide to unban the user, or keep him banned.

Once that decision is made, they can not appeal again unless they are banned again with /reban, or you accept their appeal. 

If a user is abusing the appeals system, please open a ticket in the support server; abuse of this system will result in blacklisting from Banwatch.
