## usage

To use banwatch, you need to invite the bot to your server. You can do this by
clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1047697525349564436). the bot requires the following
permissions:

- Manage server: This permission is required to set up the bot as well as access server invites and information.
- Ban members: This permission is required to check if a user has any bans, without the bot cant access bans.
- create instant invite: This allows the bot to create invites to the server the user was banned from.
- send messages: This permission is required to send messages to the channel you set up for the bot.
- use embedded activities: This permission is required to send embeds to the channel you set up for the bot.

After you have invited the bot to your server, you can set it up by using the `/config change option:Mod channel input:`
command. This command sets up the channel where the bot will post user-related information; once that is done, the bot
is ready to use and will work in the background to keep your server safe.

## Commands

Setting up the bot is straightforward and requires manage server permissions:

- `/config change option:Mod channel input:`: This command sets up the channel where the bot will post user-related
  information.

To monitor bans, you need ban member privileges:

- `/user lookup member:<user>`: Use this command to check if a specific user has any bans.

- `/user checkall`: This command checks all users in the server for any bans. The bot requires the ability to post
  files in the channel to use this command.
- `/support`: This command gives you a link to the documentation.

- `/appeal guild:<guildid>`: To appeal a ban, you can use this command. A modal will pop up where you can give your
  reason to be unbanned and the bot will send it to the server the user was banned from. You are only allowed to appeal
  once per server.

## Support

If you run into any issues or have any questions, you can join the support server by
clicking [here](https://discord.gg/sXqhbPxgGn). The support server is the best place to get help with the bot and to
report any issues you may encounter.
