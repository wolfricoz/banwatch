## What is expected of a banwatch staff member?
A banwatch staff member is often an influential member in the community or the a server owner who has volunteered their time to help ensure that the bans we verify are legitimate and without bias.

We expect:
* A banwatch staff member may not handle bans from their own servers, or when there is a conflict of interest.
* A banwatch staff member should handle evidence with care to ensure no other users are targeted.
* A banwatch staff member may investigate claims; even if these are not awaiting verification.
* A banwatch staff member must ensure that ToS is followed in the servers they visit; as well as ensuring that banwatch follows discord ToS
